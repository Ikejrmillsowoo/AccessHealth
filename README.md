# AccessHealth is a personal project I decided to undertake. After considering the state of healthcare across the world, I was insired to attempt to create a platfor where users have direct access to 
healthcare profesionals other than physicians, such as nurses, respiratory therapists, physical and occupational therapists and mental health counsolors. This allows user to ask questions and seek direction 
without having to see a physician or pay the hgh costs. 
# AccessHealth is not an emergency room or solution to life threatening instances.
