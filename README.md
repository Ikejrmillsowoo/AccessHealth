# AccessHealth is a personal project and a platform where users have direct access to healthcare profesionals.
#  Other than physicians, health proffesionals like nurses, respiratory therapists, physical and occupational therapists and mental health counsolors are available for questions and direction.
# AccessHealth is not an emergency room or solution to life threatening instances.
# How it works is any user who signs up is able to submit a question including symptoms and they will receive a reponse from the corresponding specialist.
